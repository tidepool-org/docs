### Standardized Actions

As a way of promoting and enforcing standards across our repositories/applications that use redux, we've decided to adopt the [flux standard action (FSA)](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action 'GitHub: Flux Standard Action') standard for our action objects. [The standard](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action#actions 'FSA: Actions') is very concise, logical, and easy-to-learn. In addition, there is a [`flux-standard-action`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flux-standard-action 'npm: flux-standard-action') module published to npm that exposes an `isFSA` function for testing whether an object adheres to the standard. The existence of this utility was a big factor in our decision to adopt FSA since a standard that isn't (easily) enforceable isn't much good at all. Accordingly - and as noted in [Testing Strategies](testing.md 'Testing Strategies') - we include a test to prove that each action created by our action creators passes `isFSA` in our redux unit tests.

There has been [some controversy around the way that FSA handles errors](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action/issues/17 'GitHub: FSA issue #17'), and we at Tidepool agree with @gajus that it would be better to put the `Error` object in the `error` field of an action, leaving the `payload` free to contain other information that might be needed to effect a change in the app's store. (We note this here as a reminder to ourselves to check occasionally to see if the standard has changed...)
