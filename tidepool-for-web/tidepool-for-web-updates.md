### 1.10.7 (Released 2018-05-14)
We’ve added the AADE Foundation to our Tidepool Big Data Donation Project Nonprofit Partner list. Now you can choose to support an organization providing resources to diabetes educators with your data donation.

### 1.10.5 (Released 2018-04-17)
You know how when you create a new account and we display a message that says “Please click on the link in the email we sent you at (your email address)” and (your email address) sometimes showed up on two lines if it was really long? We fixed that so now (your email address) shows up on its own line. Little details like that are important.

### 1.10.4 (Released 2018-04-09)
Sometimes data lines in the Trends view would appear to loop around, like a weird connect-the-dots drawing. We fixed that.

### 1.10.3 (Released 2018-03-29)
For users signing up for a new account, you can now see which email address you signed up with on our email verification page. If you accidentally typed in the wrong address (it happens to the best of us), you’ll know right away instead of wondering where that account verification email went.

### 1.10.2 (Released 2018-03-28)
The printed Daily view started at 5:00pm rather than midnight. Sure, time zones are weird, but we fixed that so everyone’s day starts at a logical time.

### 1.10.1 (Released 2018-03-19)
For anyone whose iPhone CGM upload is 8 weeks (or more) more recent than a pump upload, there was a small chance you may not be able to see any of your data based on how we process things behind the scenes. We cleaned up that order of operations and you can see your data again.

### 1.10.0 (Released 2018-03-19)
Tired of watching those dots bounce while your data loads? Frustrated at seeing “Aw, snap!” if Tidepool gets bogged down by all the data you’ve uploaded? Welcome to Data Paging. We’ve reengineered how we visualize your data, reducing the time spent waiting for your data to load. Scrolling through the days/weeks is also faster, too.

Along the way, we made some adjustments to how and where your bolus tooltips display.
